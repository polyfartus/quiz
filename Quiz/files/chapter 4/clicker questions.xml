        text = "A semi-trailer truck is fully loaded with marshmallows. On its next delivery, it is fully loaded with steel bars. When the truck is merging onto the highway, will it take longer for the truck to reach highway speed on the first trip or the second trip?"
        answer1 = "When the truck is full of marshmallows."
        answer2 = "When the truck is full of steel."
        answer3 = "It won’t matter because gravity is constant."
        answer4 = "When the truck is emply."

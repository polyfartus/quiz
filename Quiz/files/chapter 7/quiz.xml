        text = "Two identical blocks are released from rest at the top of two frictionless inclined planes, The top of the planes are the same height. One plane makes a 30 degree angle with the horizonal; the other plane makes a 60 degree angle. Which block is going faster when it reaches the bottom?"
        answer1 = "The block on the 30 degree inclined plane is going faster."
        answer2 = "The block on the 60 degree inclined plane is going faster."
        answer3 = "Both blocks have the same speed at the bottom."
        answer4 = "We must know the masses of the blocks to find the answer."

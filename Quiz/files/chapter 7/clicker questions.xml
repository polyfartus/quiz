        text = "The figure shows three different paths for sliding a box across the floor from point A to point B. For which path does friction do the least amount of work? Assume coeffiecent of kinetic friction = 0.21."

        points = "5"
        text = "The pendulum in the figure has a bob with a mass of 0.33 kg. At point A, the bob is 0.217 m higher than at point B. If point A is the maximum height that the bob reaches, what is the kinetic energy of the bob at point B?"
        answer1 = "(1.2 m) (0.33 kg) (9.8 m/s^2) = 3.88 J"
        answer2 = "(0.217m) (0.33 kg) (9.8 m/s^2) = 0.70 J"
        answer3 = "(1.2 m) (0.33 kg) (9.8 m/s^2) cos 35 degrees = 3.18 J"
        answer4 = "We don’t know the velocity of the bob at point B, so we cannot find the kinetic energy at point B."

        points = "5"
        text = "The figure shows the potential energy of an object moving along the x-axis without friction. If the object is released from rest at point A, rank the other points in increasing order of the object’s speed."

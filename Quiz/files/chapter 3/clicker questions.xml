        text = "A rock is thrown horizontally with a velocity v from the top of a cliff of height H. It takes a time t to reach the ground. The same rock is thrown a second time with a horizontal velocity 2v. How does the time it takes for ball to reach the ground change?"
        answer1 = "The time doubles."
        answer2 = "The time increases but by less than double."
        answer3 = "The time is cut in half."
        answer4 = "The time does not change."

        answer1 = "The velocity is zero."
        answer2 = "The velocity is to the right."
        answer3 = "The velocity is to the left."

    <question 
        points = "10"
        text = "A rock is thrown with a horizontal velocity v from the top of a cliff of height H. It hits the ground at a landing point a distance d from the base of the cliff. The rock is thrown a second time with a horizontal velocity 2v. How does distance to the landing point change?"
        answer1 = "The distance doubles."
        answer2 = "The distance increases but by less than double."
        answer3 = "The distance is cut in half."

        points = "10"
        text = "The picture shows the parabolic trajectory of a golf ball as it flies from the tee to the green. What is the direction of the ball’s acceleration at its highest point in flight?"
        answer1 = "The acceleration is up and to the right."
        answer2 = "The acceleration is down and to the right."
        answer3 = "The acceleration is up and to the left."
        answer4 = "The acceleration is straight down."

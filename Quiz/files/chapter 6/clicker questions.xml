        text = "You are loading boxes onto a truck, and you can either lift the boxes directly onto the back of the truck or slide the boxes up a ramp at an angle theta. How does the work done by you in the two methods compare?"
        answer1 = "Work 1 is grater than Work 2"
        answer2 = "Work 1 equals Work 2"
        answer3 = "Work 1 is less than Work 2"
        answer4 = "It depends on the angle of the ramp."
